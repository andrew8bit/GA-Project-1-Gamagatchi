# GA-MAGOTCHI 
## Your personal pet to keep you motivated while attending GA.

### Motivation
Tamagotchi, the once popular handheld digital pet, created in Japan by Akihiro Yokoi of *WIZ* and Aki Maita of *Bandai*, is now coming straight into your computer screen. Usually housed in an egg (**tamago**) where the user would watch (**uotchi**) and take of their pet, became mesmerizingly addicting. I grew up with a tamagotchi when I was a child but unfortunately it kept on dying. So now, I will control and program my own gotchi for Project 1 for General Assembly (GA). 

### User Stories and Wireframes
