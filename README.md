# GA-MAGOTCHI 
## Your personal pet to keep you motivated while attending GA.

### Motivation
Tamagotchi, the once popular handheld digital pet, created in Japan by Akihiro Yokoi of *WIZ* and Aki Maita of *Bandai*, is now coming straight into your computer screen. Usually housed in an egg (**tamago**) where the user would watch (**uotchi**) and take of their pet, became mesmerizingly addicting. I grew up with a tamagotchi when I was a child but unfortunately it kept on dying. So now, I will control and program my own gotchi for Project 1 for General Assembly (GA). As an added twist, we actually control our gotchi.

### User Stories and Wireframes
- User loads into splash screen.
- User clicks and checks tutorial for controls.
- User collects yellow (exp) squares.
- User avoids red and large black squares.
- Collects orange squares to feed your gatchi and green squares to heal your gatchi.  
### Technologies & Code Snippets
- Used Cavnas API to draw screen
- Object collision and hit detection with Javascript 
- Keyboard controller input controlled by use of the DOM event listeners.

### Future Developments
- Would like to rediscuss direction of the game to make an infinite side scroller, or some type of platformer. 
- I will have to get more familiar with tile mapping
- Refine collision detection. 
- Physics can be refined and I would like to refactor this code using object oriented design. Limitations currently is that only 1 instance of the object will appear and function properly.
- Sprite animation can be refined so that the entire sprite sheet is being used. Can change objects into sprites to complete the game. 
- As a first project, I have learned enough and satisifed with the MVP for this project.
